## Description
This was my first project so it includes the basic functions of HTML and CSS. My project consists of a landing page that describes me and attracts the viewers. The 'About page' further elaborates my interests.The 'Skills' page further specifies my skills and the 'projects' page showcases my projects. All elements have been created using basic functions such as grids, flex-box, utility classes etc. Also added up few micro interaction like hover effects so the site feels alive and not static. It is minimal, easy to go through with not much hazel or extra effects.
## Unique
As this was my first project I have put special emphasis on making it as minimal and easy to go through. I tried to make it simple and sober yet attractive.Even I have given a lot of importance to typography-like font weights in certain places and not using too many fonts.
## Problems Faced
Got confused at many places. Creating the perfect design/orientation was the most difficult part for me. Sometimes, it was difficult to identity why a certain function was not giving the desired output. Google and mentors played their role here. 
## Scope of improvement
I would like to add more features like a contact me button in the navigation bar. Also a fixed social media icons side baar.
## What you learned?
It was a great experience. Each time i got stuck somewhere i learned to solve that without being complacent. At the end it feels too good to say that the i made a website on my own.
